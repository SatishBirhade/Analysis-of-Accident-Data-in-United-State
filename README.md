# Analysis-of-Accident-Data-in-United-State

### Project : Analysis of US accident Data of 49 states 

### Technology : AWS cloud services (Glue, S3, Pyspark, Lambda, RDS) and Power BI to create dashboard.

### Description : - 
During my tenure, I undertook a significant project focused on leveraging the US-Accidents dataset for a range of applications related to car accidents and road safety. The dataset, collected in real-time using multiple Traffic APIs, encompassed accident data spanning from February 2016 to December 2021, covering the Contiguous United States. In this project, I applied advanced data analysis techniques to extract valuable insights and develop predictive models for real-time car accident prediction. By examining the dataset's extensive records, I identified patterns, trends, and hotspots related to accident occurrences, contributing to the understanding of accident causality and mitigating future incidents. This involved AWS cloud services, Pyton script, Mysql and data visualization tools to effectively process and interpret the vast amount of information contained in the dataset.

### Roles & Responsibilities :
1) I wrote a Python script specifically for the purpose of data cleaning.
2) Generating CI/CD pipeline in AWS for automation purpose.
3) Identifying factors contributing to accident severity.
4) Extracting valuable insights from the dataset through statistical analysis and data visualization.
5) Supporting for the other them members.
